# Colour-detection-CV2-
Accurate and reliable colour detector using python

This Python project is designed to detect and identify colors in images or video streams. It can be useful in a variety of applications, such as image processing, computer vision, and automation.

Features:
Color Detection: The project uses image processing techniques to identify and extract prominent colors within an image or video frame.

Color Identification: It provides information about the identified colors, including their names and corresponding RGB values.

Real-time Processing: The system is capable of performing color detection and identification in real-time when processing a live video stream from a webcam or other video sources.

Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used for this project.

OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is utilized for image and video processing.

K-means Clustering: K-means clustering is employed to group pixels with similar colors, helping to identify dominant colors in the image.

Color Recognition Dataset: A dataset of color names and corresponding RGB values is used for color identification.
